If you've been following our progress, you know Prompt has been working hard to bring the best speakers on the topic of Mental Health in Tech to stages, offices, work spaces, and arenas around the world. From our humble beginnings with a single corporate backer to where we stand today, with the [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/) helping us out, we have continued to push forward and get the conversation to move forward.

In the past year, we've been to so many events, from [PHP World](https://world.phparch.com/) to [ElixirDaze](http://www.elixirdaze.com/) to [Stanford University](http://125.stanford.edu/cssocial-good/) to our upcoming panel at the [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitaborg.org/)(featuring three Prompt Speakers on one stage!) and our first trip to South America for [Ruby Conf Columbia](http://www.rubyconf.co/).

We want to keep this train rolling - but to do so, we need to ask for help. We've continued to work from funds in our [original fundraiser](http://mhprompt.org/2015/10/05/our-indiegogo-story.html) but those funds have run low. Therefore, we've decided to run a new campaign.

If you have ever benefitted from our program, from the real talk of one of our speakers, from the idea that Mental Health should not be stigmatized in Tech circles, please help us to continue to deliver this message.

Take a look at our [IndieGoGo](https://igg.me/at/prompt2018) page. Give what you can to keep this mission going! If you'd like other options we are happy to share your story on our blog. We also appreciate corporate sponsors - any interested parties can [get in touch with us](mailto:team@mhprompt.org).

We look forward to bringing more speakers forward, more stories of what it's like to live and work with mental illness in tech, and more light to the lives of those suffering in silence.
