Workers in the tech industry can seem like cool, cutting-edge mavericks that don’t let the rest of the mundane world hold them back, but they’re human too. Humans who feel grief and great sadness when they suffer a loss. Grief causes distinct loneliness, depression and a host of other maladies but these, in turn, can have additional adverse effects on members of the tech industry. It is important for these tech sector employees to understand the unique results of grief in their world.

## Physical Afflictions

The tech industry is a stressful place with long hours, project deadlines, cutthroat competition and more. This stress is coupled with the often-sedentary nature of office work and makes a dangerous combination. Together they [lead to increased health complications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439723/) in technology employees

If that wasn’t bad enough, [grief by itself causes even more health problems](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/understanding-how-grief-weakens-the-body/380006/) like increased risk of bacterial infections, aggravated physical pain and increased blood pressure. With so many drains on the body of a tech sector employee, it is important to safeguard health especially in times of bereavement.

## Extended Absences

[Grief is a natural response to loss](https://www.funeralguide.co.uk/coping-with-loss-and-grief/), and it takes time to work through. Leaves of absences are common while survivors work up the motivation to continue work or get back to 100 percent. Unfortunately for workers in the technology industry, time is not often a luxury they have.

The fast-paced world they live in is all too happy to [leave people and ideas by the wayside](https://readwrite.com/2013/05/01/10-technology-skills-no-longer-in-demand/) in favor of the fresh and brand new. Tech employees may feel they cannot afford to be out of the loop for so long not take the time they need, prolonging the grieving process. Those who do take the time might find themselves replaced or obsolete upon returning.

## More Bad News for Tech Workers Over 50

Grief most often hits older people as their friends and family age. The problem is, these aging members of the technology sector are [already under more stress](http://www.businessinsider.com/stressful-lives-of-older-tech-workers-2015-11) and uncertainty than their younger counterparts. A sudden dip in productivity or spike in stress-induced illness caused by grief might be just the excuse needed for an industry dominated by the young that is looking to put older employees out to pasture.

## All Is Not Lost

Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of good news when it comes to loss and bereavement, less so in the tech industry. But it is important for workers in the industry to know just what they are in for when people in their position are going through grief so they can get help.
