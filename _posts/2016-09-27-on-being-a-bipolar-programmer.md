This will relate my mental health from building word finds on a [Lanier](http://www.vintagecomputer.net/browse_thread.cfm?id=211) to [Apigility](https://apigility.org/) for Zend Framework.

I don't have a lot of memories of childhood.  My Mormon upbringing meant I knew right from wrong at 8 years old and I was beat just for showing creativity.  I finally joined the Army National Guard at the age of 17 to get out of the house.

I was diagnosed with ADHD around 5th grade.  My parents had taken me to a specialist before then but he didn't find any other diagnosis.  This puts me on the autism spectrum and I believe today that I was more than mildly autistic.  I was put on a drug which when I took it and finished two months of math homework in one day scared my teachers.  I must have been on the razors edge for special education.  I never was assigned for specific care or teaching.

When the family received a [C=128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128) for Christmas I took to it.  At first [Jumpman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpman) and the arcade classics eventually moving into Ultima 1-5.  Well, Ultima 1-4 then I had to return 5 because it was to chaotic and God told my dad it was not good.  I got a programming book for the 128 and Superbase.  The best I did was create a HUD (Heads Up Display) for The Last Starfighter which worked ok but was still sprite based.  I really liked Gary Kitchen's Game Maker.

I believe people with mental health issues gravitate to computing because it's a very cerebral act and you make up your own rules for behavior.  

In the army I worked as a pharmacy technician.  I bought a 386/40 computer and started attending [Comdex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMDEX).  I've never fit in at those trade shows because I wasn't in the industry, but I was learning in the very slow way I do.  Fortunately, once I can learn behavior or data it sticks pretty well.  I took over the DBASE IV databases for the University of Utah Hospital Pharmacy.  Working with all Pharm D's after a year it was my decision to go back to school or find something different so I went back to databases.

Years later I found myself owning a house I cannot sell.  This was miserable, so I quit my job of about 6 years to force a short sell or a foreclosure.  While I owned this house I built up [db.etree.org](http://db.etree.org).  This project is still mine today but the logistics of it all means [ibiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/) is the final say.  It was db.etree which allowed me to progress in my PHP programming as it is the first site I created and it's still running today.  I short sold the house and decided to live on credit cards.  

I was 32 and woke up in the middle of the night and looked out the window and a street lamp switched off.  I suddenly felt I could "read between the lines".  I felt very productive that day and called my parents a couple times to talk about whatever was on my mind.  That evening my parents had me committed to the University of Utah hospital.  My earliest childhood fear was being institutionalized and that is what happened.  

I don't know what triggered bipolar in me or whether it has been there all along.  Was my nervous system handicap because of my isolated upbringing?  Was I too inexperienced to live life from my age without a larger world view and better social skills?  

I felt blind, like I was just now seeing people for the first time, and I was.  I was in the hospital for a few days and had a hard time grasping what was (or generally what is not) going on there.  They released me with a prescription for Depakote but without an understanding of what bipolar is or what it feels like or what the symptoms are.

I did not continue taking it.

A few months later my girlfriend I would/could have married was gone and I was living alone toying with LEDs, circuit boards, designing traces and building PICAXE toys for personal use.  I had a depressive episode and felt suicidal.  I scared myself so I went to a government agency to tell someone because that was all I could think to do.  I was put in the hospital again for a week or so.  Again Depakote and again I didn't know what it meant to be bipolar and again I went off doctor's orders.

Somewhere in there I was arrested for weed; my first brush with the law in my life.  There were more to come.  Assault on my father in Las Vegas when he tried to grab the keys from the moving car.  Assault on a woman I lived with in Lake County.  Finally an assault on a stranger.  By the time this happened I'd been diagnosed bipolar for four years.  But I get ahead of myself.

[Apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) was the biggest problem, I feel, about being bipolar.  In programming it's a gift to relate the unrelated but when your brain does the relationships without a conscious guide then spits out the results as though your conscious self had gone through them deliberately, there is no choice but to believe what your brain is telling you.  And here lies my inability to decipher the truth.  My internal checksums appear fine to me.  And it was once I recognized the truth that I could not tell right from wrong anymore that proved to me I was bipolar.

I was fortunate to not be charged with a felony for anything I did, but I spent two weeks in a prison psyche ward.  When an opening appeared at the regional hospital I was sent there for two weeks.  About 24 hours after I was admitted I saw only two choices:  check out or get better, so I got better, and on meds I can live with.  I left a path of hurt behind me those four years and I'm sorry for what I did and to those I hurt.

At this point accepting a bi-polar diagnosis wasn't hard and I complied with doctor's orders then and every day without fail ever since.  That was over eight years ago.  During this time I've got to work with some of the top people in my field of PHP programming and I've made many offerings to the open source community.  I've followed right along with the development of Zend Framework 2 and contributed much to [Apigility](https://apigility.org/).

The best advice I can give about mental illness is if your doctor gives you a diagnosis: believe her!  

There is never a right time to talk about mental illness and in my experience people I broach the subject with don't have questions about the illness and usually ask if I'm under a doctor's care.  That's an embarrassing and deeply personal question to me but I share the truth and it works for me.
